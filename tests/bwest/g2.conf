# Each tuple is a network link, host-switch or switch-switch.
# Format of each tuple is (linkID, node1, node2), linkIDs should be integers starting at 1.
# It is recommended that switch-switch links are specified first, followed by switch-host links.
# 6 flows and 4 links smallFlow example:
links: (1,s1,s2);(2,s2,s3);(3,s3,s4);(4,s4,s5);(5,h1,s1);(6,h2,s2);(7,h3,s3);(8,h4,s4);(9,h5,s5);
